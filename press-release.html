  <p class="meta">Anthony Armanios</p>

  <h2>Part 1: Opening Paragraph</h2>
  <p>
    On <strong>Thursday, February 6, 2026, from 1:00–2:30 PM</strong>, 
    <strong>third-year York University student Anthony Armanios</strong> will host an informal 
    <strong>study and planning session for CCY (Children, Childhood &amp; Youth) majors</strong> 
    in <strong>Scott Library, Room 203</strong>, bringing together students who are navigating 
    degree requirements, credit planning, and upcoming course selections. The session focuses on 
    clarifying graduation pathways, understanding credit distribution, and reducing last-minute 
    academic stress as summer enrollment approaches, making it especially relevant for students who 
    are unsure how their current credits align with program expectations.
